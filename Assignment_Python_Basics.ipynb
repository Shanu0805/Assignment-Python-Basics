        "1. **What is Python, and why is it popular?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->Python is a popular, versatile, and easy-to-learn programming language widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, and more, due to its readability, extensive libraries, and a large, supportive community. Python's simple and readable syntax makes it easier to learn and use compared to other programming languages.Python has a large and active community of developers who contibutes to its development, provide support and create libraries and frareworks.\n",

        "2. **What is an interpreter in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-readable instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->Python has several predefined or reserved keywords that have special meanings and uses in the language. These keywords are part of the Python syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or class names) because they are reserved for specific purposes. The shortcut keys in python to show all pre-defined keywords are given below:\n",
        "    [import keyword]\n",
        "    [print(keyword;kwlist)]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    ->No, Keywords cannot used as varaible names in Python because keywords have special meanings in the Python language syntax, and if you try to use a keyword as a variable name, it will result in a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What is mutability in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->The reason why lists are mutable and tuples are immutable in Python comes down to design decisions related to how these data structures are used and their performance implications. Here's a deeper look into the differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "        *Lists: Lists are designed to be general-purpose containers that are flexible and allow frequent modifications. They are mutable because they need to support operations like adding, removing, and changing elements dynamically. Lists are often used in situations where elements need to change during the program's execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Example:\n",
        "                my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "                my_list.append(4)  # Adding an element\n",
        "                my_list[0] = 10    # Modifying an element\n",
        "                print(my_list)      # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "        *Tuples: Tuples, on the other hand, are meant to be lightweight and are often used to represent fixed collections of items that should not be modified. By making tuples immutable, Python ensures that their content is fixed and reliable once created, which makes them suitable for use as keys in dictionaries, or in situations where data integrity is important.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Example:\n",
        "                my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "                my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will raise an error because tuples are immutable\n",

        "\n",
        "       ->In Python, the == and is operators are used for comparison, but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "         a. == (Equality Operator):The == operator checks if two objects have the same value.\n",
        "            It compares the data/content of the objects, meaning it checks if the values of two objects are equivalent.\n",
        "            Example:- a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "                      b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "                      print(a==b)   # True (they have the same values)\n",
        "\n",
        "         b. is (Identity Operator): This is operator check if two objects are the same object in memory.\n",
        "            Examplew:- a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "                       b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "                       print(a is b) #False (they are two different obejcts in memory)\n",

        "8. **What are logical operators in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements or expressions to form complex logical conditions. They return a boolean value (True or False) based on the evaluation of the expressions.\n",

        "9. **hat is type casting in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->Type casting (also known as type conversion) in Python is the process of converting one data type into another. Python provides several built-in functions to cast between types. This can be useful when you need to perform operations on different types of data but they need to be in a compatible form.\n",
        "\n",

        "10. **What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?**\n",

If the elif condition is True, its corresponding block of code is executed. You can use multiple elif statements to handle different scenarios. If all conditions are False, the program moves on to the next part (or an else block, if provided).\n",
